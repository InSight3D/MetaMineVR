# Vision and Values

## Our Vision

{% hint style="info" %}
**Good to know:** We're going to have a VR game, in which you can 'mine' real cryptocurrency. You can discover better 'ore', and that gets you more money. This will be it's own hosted token, so it is it's own cryptocurrency. People can pay to buy ads on the game, where they will be displayed on walls. Better pickaxes means more money, higher chances of better ore, and more. You will be able to visit this website to claim the crypto by logging into your secure account.
{% endhint %}

Our company vision is to **be the leading video game/crypto mix** and to **make money** through a beautiful, practical, consciously-produced game.

## Our Values

{% hint style="info" %}
**Good to know:** company values are statements about how you approach work; how you treat colleagues, customers and users; and what your company stands for.
{% endhint %}

### Be Compassionate

We treat everyone we encounter with compassion, seeing the humanity behind their problems and experiences.

### Be Mindful

We do not take advantage of our users' attention and adopt mindful working practices so that we can create safe spaces both in our working environment and in our products themselves.

### Research First

We challenge our own and others' assumptions through qualitative and quantitative research. Not sure about an idea? Test it.
